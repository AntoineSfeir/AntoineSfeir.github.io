## Project Description

     The goal is recreate Space Invaders with my spin that gives classical arcade experience using P5.js, Tone.js, and a controller that was built with an Arduino. 

## How to Play

- Players have the ability to control the game via keyboard or arduino controller. 

- If player uses the keyboard, press "enter" to start. The "left" and "right" arrow keys are to move and the space bar is to shoot. 

- For the arduino controller, once it is connected to the browser, toggle the joystick to start. the joystick is also used to move  and shoot once the game has started.

## Gameplay
      Space Invaders style game play, where the player moves and shoots at aliens that shoot back. There are barriers in the game that player can hide behind and they reset at the beginning of every new wave if they are all destroyed. There are five types of enemies and each of them will earn you different points if you shoot them. The fifth enemy is a boss enemy that is equipped with tracking missiles. The controller's LED color changed depending on gameplay. If a player hits an enemy the light turns green, but if the enemy hits the player the light turns red. Finally, the light turn blue if the player shoots boss enemy. There are six waves so far.

## Future Development
        Thoughts for future development include adding power ups, more enemies, better sound effects and adding a mode for endless waves. I would like to add a buzzer to the controller and switch from using the joystick to buttons.
